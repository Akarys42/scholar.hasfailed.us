# Google Scholar has failed us.

We are trans authors of published papers. We need you to avoid using the trans-exclusionary site Google Scholar.

## What's wrong with Google Scholar?

- Google Scholar, unlike competing platforms (such as [ResearchGate][], [Semantic Scholar][], and [IA Scholar][]), provides no meaningful way for an author to update their name throughout the service.

- While it is possible to update your name and references on your profile page, these changes have no effect on Google Scholar search results.

- Google Scholar frequently requires that you deadname a trans author to give any relevant results for them. Even after an author creates a profile page with their correct name, searching for that name does not yield their papers as search results.

- Google Scholar is incompatible with policies and processes that publishers have created to allow authors to change names.

- When an author updates their paper in a published repository, the paper and correct citations of it will be missing from search results or ranked unreasonably low for a while.

- Google Scholar provides citations (in BibTeX and other formats) that are outdated and contain an author’s deadname, even when the paper has been updated.

- Google Scholar can be convinced to update its belief about your name, but it is a very lengthy process that seems to quire getting a majority of people to cite you by your correct name and then waiting several months. This is an unreasonable burden, and is unattainable by many authors.

- Google is the most influential organization in scientific publishing to _not_ enter [a partnership affirming the ability of trans authors to change their names][partnership].

## Why is this so important?

Deadnaming is hate speech. It violates the code of conduct of many communities.

Deadnaming -- deliberately calling a trans person by their deadname -- is done to trans people by their transphobic harassers to deny their ability to transition. Sadly, it is also done by bureaucracies and corporations, but this does not make it right.

Scholar’s combination of deadnaming and burying relevant search results, over a long period of time, denies the ability of transgender authors to participate in research the way they would if they were cisgender (the opposite of transgender).

The correct way to refer to a trans author is by their chosen name. Google Scholar is very regressive compared to other research repositories on this issue.

Many trans authors consider it easier to change careers than to change their name within academia, and Google Scholar is the most prominent reason for this.

## But I've heard Google is a great place for trans employees! Surely they're working on it.

In 2019, the Google Scholar team responded to an employee who raised the issue internally: "We don't support name changes."

Google seems to see their affirmation of trans rights as a perk that they offer to their highest-paid employees. It took a campaign by the Alphabet Workers' Union to get them to [#DropTheDeadnames][] for their numerous temporary, vendor, and contract workers.

Non-employees, such as most trans researchers, are of course at the mercy of their product decisions.

Google employees are losing control of the ethics of their products. In 2019, five employee activists (three of whom were trans) were [fired for their activism][thanksgiving-five]. In 2020, Timnit Gebru and Margaret Mitchell, who had [advocated internally for proper representation of trans authors in Google Scholar][timnit-statement], were fired by Jeff Dean for their ethics research.

## Our demands

We demand that Google fully support the ability for trans authors to change their names, in accordance with the Committee on Publication Ethics' [principles on name changes][cope-principles].

- Google must allow authors to claim their papers, and use that information in organic search results.

- If an author wishes to change their name and deprecate their old name, Google must update their displayed name in all search results for and references to those papers.

- Google must allow authors to report erroneous, harmful results about them, and empower an actual person to act on these reports.

- Google must document this process so that authors who change their name in the future can more easily follow it.

- Because legal name changes are difficult, expensive, and in some places impossible, Google must not require legal documentation of name changes.

Google has ignored these issues for years. Until Google takes these steps, we cannot recommend the use of Google Scholar. It is a trans-exclusionary site that harms the ability of trans authors to succeed in their careers.

## What can I do?

- Instead of Google Scholar, use alternatives such as [Semantic Scholar][], and recommend that others do as well.
- Share this petition so that it gets more attention and acquires more signatures from authors.
- If you are a trans or non-binary author, please sign this petition by [opening a GitHub pull request][pull-request] to add your name, or by e-mailing Robyn Speer (**rspeer @ arborelia.net**) with the subject "Google Scholar petition" and the information you would like added.
